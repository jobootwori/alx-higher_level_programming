# 0x02. Python - import & modules
 _Projects done during **Full Stack Software Engineering studies** at **African Leadership University School**. The aim of the projects is to learn about `functions, modules and strings` in `Python language.`_


```sh
#Trying Bash duh!
```

# Technologies
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on `Ubuntu 20.04 LTS` using `python3 (version 3.8.5)`
- Your code should use the `pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)`

# Projects 
The following are the ALX School projects.

| File Name | Description |
| ------ | ------ |
| [0-strcat.c]() | `Write a program that imports the function def add(a, b): from the file add_0.py and prints the result of the addition 1 + 2 = 3

    You have to use print function with string format to display integers
    You have to assign:
        the value 1 to a variable called a
        the value 2 to a variable called b
        and use those two variables as arguments when calling the functions add and print
    a and b must be defined in 2 different lines: a = 1 and another b = 2
    Your program should print: <a value> + <b value> = <add(a, b) value> followed with a new line
    You can only use the word add_0 once in your code
    You are not allowed to use * for importing or __import__
    Your code should not be executed when imported - by using __import__, like the example below
` |
| [1-strncat.c]() | `a function that concatenates two strings` |
| [2-strncpy.c]() | `a function that copies a string` |
| [3-strcmp.c]() | `a function that compares two strings` |
| [4-rev_array.c]() | `a function that reverses the content of an array of integers` |
| [5-string_toupper.c]() | `a function that changes all lowercase letters of a string to uppercase` |
| [6-cap_string.c]() | `a function that capitalizes all words of a string` |
| [7-leet.c]() | `a function that encodes a string into` `1337` |
| [100-rot13.c]() | `a function that encodes a string using` `rot13` |
| [101-print_number.c]() | `a function that prints an integer` |
